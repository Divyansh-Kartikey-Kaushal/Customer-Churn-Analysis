# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Introduction
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship or subscription with a company or service provider. It represents the rate at which customers stop using a company's products or services within a specific period. Churn is an important metric for businesses as it directly impacts revenue, growth, and customer retention.

## 🔍 Understanding Churn
In the context of the Churn dataset, the churn label indicates whether a customer has churned or not:
- ✅ **Churned Customer**: A customer who has decided to discontinue their subscription or usage of the company's services.
- 🔄 **Non-Churned Customer**: A customer who continues to remain engaged and retains their relationship with the company.

Understanding customer churn is crucial for businesses to identify patterns, factors, and indicators that contribute to customer attrition. By analyzing churn behavior and its associated features, companies can develop strategies to:
- 🎯 Retain existing customers
- 😊 Improve customer satisfaction
- 📉 Reduce customer turnover

📈 Predictive modeling techniques can also be applied to forecast and proactively address potential churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers.
